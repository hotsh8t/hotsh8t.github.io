## 2.Tokens and Products
- 3 Types of Tokens

    - **Payment tokens/cryptocurrencies**
tokens which are intended to be used, now or in the future, as a means of
payment for acquiring goods or services or as a means of money or value
transfer. Cryptocurrencies give rise to no claims on their issuer.
    - **Utility tokens**
tokens which are intended to provide access digitally to an application or
service by means of a blockchain-based infrastructure.
    - **Asset tokens**
assets such as a debt or equity claim on the issuer. Asset tokens
promise, for example, a share in future company earnings or future
capital flows. In terms of their economic function, therefore, these
tokens are analogous to equities, bonds or derivatives. Tokens which
enable physical assets to be traded on the blockchain also fall into this
category.
