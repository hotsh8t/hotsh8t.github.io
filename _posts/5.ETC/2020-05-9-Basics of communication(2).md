# BASICS OF Business Data Communication(2)  
 

# [1]. Data Flows with Different Line Configurations  

## 1. Data Flows  
+ **Simplex** : One way only
    + 
+ Half Duplex : One way, then the other
    - data may travel in both directions, but only in one direction at a time​data may travel in both directions, but only in one direction at a time​data may travel in both directions, but only in one direction at a time​data may travel in both directions, but only in one direction at a time​data may travel in both directions, but only in one direction at a time​
    - provides non-simultaneous two-way communication​
    - computers use control signals to negotiate when to send and when to receive  
    - the time it takes to switch between sending and receiving is called turnaround time
+ Full Duplex : both ways at the same time

## 2. Transmission Mode  
+ Parallel / Series 모드가 있음

    - parallel :
    - Series :
        * Asynchronous :start/stop bits per unit  
            - Serial communication
        * Synchronous : Block of units

    - Data Link Layer – Managing Data Flow
        OSI LAYER
## 3. Flow Control

# [2]. Communication Impairments  ​  

# [3]. Security of Communication Human Threats to Communications  
- CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY, NON-REPUDIATION 이 중요하다.   
## 1. Security Control
- Threats

- Security Measures

## 2. Cryptography

- Caesar Ciphers

- Transposition Ciphers

- Cyrptography
    - Cipher
    - Key

- Cryptanalysis

- Encryption & Decryption
    - Encryption on computers 
    - Asymmetric Key Cryptography
    - Symetric/Private Key Encryption


- RSA Cryptography

    - ENcr


## 3. Other Applications of Public/Private Keys  
    - Digital Certificates  
    - Digital Signature  
    - How PGP Works - Encryption  







# [4]. Communication Performance Improvement  

## 1.Performance Measurements

## 2. Response Time  

## 3. How to imporoce Efficiency


## 3. Lossless comporession
- Comporession :
    - Based on **code words:** Huffman codes
    - Based on **dictionaries:** Lemple-Ziv, Lemple-Ziv-Welch
    - Lossy :reconstituted data is only `perceptually equialent`(jpeg, mpeg)

- Huffman Decoding

## multiplexing?
