1). Youn, Hyejin, et al. "Invention as a combinatorial process: evidence from US patents." Journal of The Royal Society Interface 12.106 (2015): 20150272.

- **Invention as a combinatorial process : evidence from US Patents **
    -  Invention has been commonly conceptualized as **a search over a space of combinatorial possibilities**.
    - US patent records dating from 1790 to 2010 to formally characterize invention
    as **a combinatorial process**.
    - The authors find that the combinatorial inventive process exhibits an invariant
    rate of **‘exploitation’** *(refinements of existing combinations of technologies)* and **‘exploration’** *(the development of new technological combinations)*. 
- Patents as footprints of invention
    - Some inventions, namely those that are patented, leave behind a
    documentary trail, enabling us to study the invention processes in a systemic
    way.
    - Every US patent must have one and only one principal mandatory
    classification but may optionally include one or more additional ‘discretionary’
    codes.
        - ✓ There are currently 474 technology classes and approximately 161,000
technology codes. 

- Invention as a combinatorial process<br>
    - patents
    - the collection of distinct technologies
    - **the set of distinct combination of codes**
